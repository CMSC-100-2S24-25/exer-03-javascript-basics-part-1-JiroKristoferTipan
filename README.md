# Key Takeaways:
- JavaScript is a way to be able to add code and functionality to my html and css projects. It has a lot of the common features of your stadard coding language such as variables, loops, functions, and objects(may be referred to structs in other languages). 

- a feature that makes JavaScript unique from others is the strict comparison done by adding another equals sign. This allows you to compare even the data type to see if the values are the same, like 0 & false or 1 & "1".
